# Wang_Qian_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary 

The project shows a system of renting and returning books, and it can be used in libraries and bookstores. We mainly use the binary tree structure which includes other data structures such as dynamic memory, structs and linked lists for this project. We use the tree to build a tree to store the information of book such as the names of books, the authors of books, and the quantities of the books. The project has a menu, and you can make a selection and type the number of the decision after read the menu. By making a selection, you can find books that you want, rent them, see the total books that you decide to rent and return them after finish the books. In addition, if you don’t want rent a book, you can delete them before finish the process. What’s more, we use the single linked list to store the books you borrowed so you can see the total books list when you don’t know what book you want to rent. 


How to Run 

This section contains instructions, with examples, of how to run your program. 
It’s easy to use because only need to type the number of selection and the title of the book you want. For example, first, you should open the project and run the code. Next, if you want find a book, you should type the number 1 and then type the title of the book. If you don’t know what book you want rent, you can type the number 3 in order to see all the book and find one you want.
